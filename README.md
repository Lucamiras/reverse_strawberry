An attempt at implementing chain-of-thought reasoning similar to what the o1 model can do. If not possible, at least I learned something about langchain ...

## Steps:
1. Use o1 and investigate the thought process
2. Try to build one or multiple agents with prompts that emulate this
3. ???
4. Probably no profit
